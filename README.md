# Shop-Site-Template
 
# A simple shop idea I replicated from another site, I liked the idea of the sliding images.

# I used some assets from other sites for filler images, PULL&BEAR mainly for the clothes.
# The logo was made by me in photoshop

# Other assests were found online from different sites.

# The 'shop-example.html' is just a example of what the shop would actually look like, just to add a little more detail to the site.
# All assets would change using server-side code, it would fetch any products in stock a create the front cards. (with valid links)

# The JS was done by me however it's very simple and not very efficient on system recources.

# The CSS might look messy, however I used SASS to create it so it made it a lot easier to read and edit.
# I did try a new naming convention on this design, it does make the HTML look messy however.
